# Introduction

For my final capstone project at BrainStation, I decided to create a machine learning model that would predict the outcome of the 2019 NCAA March Madness Tournament. The data was sourced from the Kaggle competition: “Google Cloud & NCAA ML Competition 2019 – Men’s”. Using the average season statistics, seeding, tournament rating, and region of each game from 2008-2017 to train the model, the model is ultimately able to predict the probability of a team winning given any matchup they might encounter in the tournament. The end goal of this project is to accurately predict as many games correctly as possible, even potentially outperforming the brackets made by FiveThirtyEight and ESPN.
